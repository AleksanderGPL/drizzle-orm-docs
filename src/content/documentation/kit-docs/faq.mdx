# FAQ & Troubleshooting

### **Should I use `generate` or `push`?**

Those are logically 2 different commands. `generate` is used to create an sql file together with additional
information needed for `drizzle-kit` (or any other migration tool).

After generating those migrations, they won't be applied to a database. 
You need to do it in the next step. You can read more about it **[here](/kit-docs/faq#how-do-i-apply-migrations-generated-by-drizzle-kit)**

On the other hand, `push` doesn't need any migrations to be generated. It will
simply sync your schema with the database schema. Please be careful when using it;
we recommend it only for local development and local databases. To read more about it, check out **[`drizzle-kit push`](/kit-docs/overview#prototyping-with-db-push)**


## Troubleshooting

### **Why aren't my CLI options being read by drizzle-kit?**

Drizzle Kit has a current set of priorities for reading config options:

1. If there is a `drizzle.config` file, read from it.
2. If there is no `drizzle.config` file, check for the `--config` option in the CLI.
3. If no `--config` option was found, use CLI options; otherwise, read from a defined config.

If you specify both config parameters and CLI options, an error will be thrown, and you should use 
either CLI options or have a config file defined in your project.
